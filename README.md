# Machine learning and ensemble analysis for AGB
Machine learning and ensemble analysis estimate for predicting above-ground biomass (AGB)

The code contains following:
1. Feature selection algorithm (Boruta and VIF)
2. Modelling techniques (GAMM, kNN, SVM, ANN and RF)
3. Spatial autocorrelation
4. Sensitivity analysis
5. Data analysis (includes manuscript and supplementary materials figures)

Code 1-4 are coded in 'R', whereas 5 is coded in 'python'.
Analysis that is not covered in above code were done using either ArcGIS or ERDAS Imagine.
